# SlowFood Revisarik

## Description
This is the Client of the full stack application we created as a made-up online pizzeria. In this application, you have a list of three pizzas that you at the beginning can't interact with. You have to become a registered user by providing the site with an email, password and password confirmation. After that you will see an "Add to Order" button that gives you the ability to add a pizza to your order. The pizzas are also sorted into categories and you can choose to only see one type of pizzas.
